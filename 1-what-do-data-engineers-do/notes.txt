If I will be hired as data engineer to enable data analytics in a company, then 
-> First of all I will try to understand what type of data can be collected from all the data sources.
-> Secondly, I will communicate with the stakeholders that what type of analytics they want from the data.
-> I will also engage with the other data professionals, if any, to understand their viewpoint.
-> I will understand their requirement and will collect the data relevant to the required analytics.
-> I will also keep the future in my thought and will collect that data which can improve the data maturity of the company.
